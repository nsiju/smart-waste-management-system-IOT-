🗑️ Smart Waste Management System (Smart Bin Project)
📘 Overview

The Smart Waste Management System aims to modernize the way waste is collected and managed in urban areas. It uses IoT-based sensors and a GSM communication module to detect bin status, send notifications, and assist waste collectors through route optimization. This system helps maintain cleaner cities, reduces collection costs, and improves operational efficiency.

⚙️ Features

🔍 Real-time Waste Level Detection using ultrasonic and infrared sensors.

📲 SMS Notifications via SIM808 GSM module when the bin is full.

📡 GPS Integration for precise location tracking of each smart bin.

⚡ Automatic Lid Control using a servo motor based on sensor input.

🧠 Manual Button Control for on-demand lid operation.

💡 GSM Status Indicator LED to show module activity even without a SIM card.

🗺️ Software Integration for waste collectors to view bin locations and plan optimized routes.

🧩 Hardware Components
Component	Function
Arduino/ESP32 (Controller)	Controls all modules and sensors
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	Detects waste fill level
Infrared Sensor	Detects object presence or bin opening
SIM808 GSM + GPS Module	Sends SMS alerts and tracks location
Servo Motor	Controls lid opening and closing
Push Button	Manual control of the lid
LED Indicator	Displays GSM module status
Power Supply	Provides required voltage to the circuit
🧠 Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the waste level inside the bin.

The infrared sensor verifies if the lid area is clear or if the bin is being accessed.

When the bin reaches a full threshold, the controller triggers the SIM808 module to send an SMS alert to the waste collector.

The servo motor automatically opens the lid when waste is detected near the opening or via button input.

The GPS module provides the bin’s location data, which is sent to the integrated application for optimized collection.

The LED blinks or stays solid to indicate the GSM module’s operational status.

💻 Software Application (Integration)

A web or mobile application connects with the bins to:

Display bin locations using GPS data.

Track fill levels and status (Full/Empty).

Suggest optimized collection routes for waste collectors.

Store and analyze collection data for management insights.
